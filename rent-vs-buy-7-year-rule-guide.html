        <h1>Rent vs Buy 7-Year Rule Guide</h1>
        <p>Use the 7-year rule as a starting heuristic, then replace it with scenario-based math.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card">
        <h2>What the 7-year rule means</h2>
        <p>The rule suggests buying is often more favorable if you expect to stay around seven years or longer. The intuition is that upfront transaction costs need time to amortize, and equity builds slowly in early mortgage years.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>When the rule fails</h2>
        <p>The seven-year benchmark can break in either direction depending on local costs and assumptions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shorter break-even: high rents, modest purchase costs, stronger appreciation</li>
          <li>Longer break-even: high taxes, large maintenance burden, high sell costs, low expected hold period</li>
          <li>Uncertain break-even: probable move within a few years</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>Scenario matrix to run</h2>
        <p>Model at least three scenarios before deciding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conservative: lower appreciation, higher maintenance, higher sell costs</li>
          <li>Baseline: current best estimate</li>
          <li>Optimistic: stronger appreciation and stable ownership costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">If buying only wins in optimistic assumptions, the decision is fragile.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>Decision checkpoint</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Expected stay duration exceeds your modeled break-even by a safe margin</li>
          <li>Post-closing reserves remain healthy</li>
          <li>Total net cost win is robust across conservative and baseline scenarios</li>
          <li>Lifestyle and job-location flexibility are still acceptable</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
