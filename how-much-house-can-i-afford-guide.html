        <h1>How Much House Can I Afford?</h1>
        <p>A practical framework for setting a safe budget range before you shop listings.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card">
        <h2>1) Start with payment capacity, not listing price</h2>
        <p>Estimate a monthly housing ceiling using both front-end and back-end debt-to-income limits. Use the lower of the two outputs as your planning cap.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Front-end DTI: housing payment divided by gross monthly income</li>
          <li>Back-end DTI: housing plus debt payments divided by gross monthly income</li>
          <li>Treat this cap as a ceiling, then set a lower target for flexibility</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>2) Include all ownership costs</h2>
        <p>Affordability mistakes usually come from ignoring non-mortgage costs. Build your monthly estimate with principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA, and baseline maintenance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Property tax and insurance often rise over time</li>
          <li>Maintenance can vary widely by home age and region</li>
          <li>HOA and utilities can materially change total payment</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>3) Protect cash reserves after closing</h2>
        <p>Down payment and closing costs are not enough. Leave reserves for repairs, job changes, and emergency spending so the home does not become a liquidity risk.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Model your post-closing emergency fund explicitly</li>
          <li>Budget for move-in and near-term repairs</li>
          <li>Avoid spending all discretionary cash on down payment alone</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="panel card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>4) Stress-test before making offers</h2>
        <p>Run conservative scenarios to avoid overfitting to one optimistic assumption set.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase rate assumption by at least 0.5-1.0%</li>
          <li>Increase maintenance and tax assumptions</li>
          <li>Test a temporary income reduction case</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">If the budget still works under stress, your target range is more robust.</p>
